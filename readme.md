## Esensi Core Components Package

Esensi is an awesome Laravel boilerplate application. This package contains the foundational components that make up Esensi and from which other Esensi packages rely upon. If you are starting a new Esensi-based project then you should start by forking the [Esensi boilerplate](http://github.com/esensi/esensi) repository which includes this package as a Composer dependency.
